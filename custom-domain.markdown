# <span>Setting up</span> custom domain

To set up PortfolioDeck to work with a custom domain you need a few things:

* A domain name.
* A DNS service provider.
* A couple of A-records pointing towards 95.131.248.79 and 95.131.248.XYZ

If you've done this sort of thing before that should be all the information you need. Most people, however, have more healthy hobbies and may not have a clue to what we're talking about. So let's go through it point by point:

## Buying a domain name

You may of course use any available domain name registrar but we recommend the swedish provider "Loopia":http://www.loopia.com/domainnames. We've been using them for a long time and we've had very little trouble. They also have a fairly easy interface for DNS setup that anyone should be able to use. Let's walk through the process:

### 1. Make sure your domain name is not taken

Go to "the domain search on Loopia":http://www.loopia.com/domainnames and fill out your desired domain name, ie. myportfolio.com (no www in front of the name). Click search.

If the name you search for is already taken it will be marked with a red dot and can not be selected. If that is the case you may have to try another name or a variation.

### 2. Sign up

Select your domain name in the "Domain name options" list. Scroll down and make sure you select "Only order domain name" and "Create new account". 

Take a look at the "Invoice specification". It should not contain anything else than the price of the domain name (Swedish VAT will be stated but included in the price). The prices are in swedish Kronor. You may "easily convert to your currency of choice using Google":http://www.google.com/search?q=79+SEK+in+EUR.

Fill out your "Owner information" and click on "Order".

AND THEN S**K MY B***Z Loopia. You can simply NOT require a swedish personal ID no from international customers!!!!
