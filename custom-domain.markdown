# <span>Setting up</span> custom domain

To set up PortfolioDeck to work with a custom domain you will need:

* A domain name.
* A DNS service provider.
* A couple of A-records pointing towards *95.131.248.79* and *95.131.248.XYZ*

## Domain purchasing and DNS setup

Some For Swedish and European domain names you have [Loopia](http://www.loopia.com/domainnames). For .com and other international domains you can use [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/). They both offer domain registration as well as DNS services. There are a bunch of others as well and you may use whoever you prefer. Registring and setting up a domain  can be a bit tricky so if you don't feel comfortable dealing with this kind of stuff we recommend that you ask a friend.

## After setup

It's important that you let PortfolioDeck know about your new domain. If you haven't done so already: click the customize tab on your PortfolioDeck admin page and then select "Add a custom domain name". Enter the domain name you've purchased and click "Save changes".

Please note that after you've set up your new domain you may need to wait up to 72 hours for the change to take effect. This is just how DNS works - please be patient :)
