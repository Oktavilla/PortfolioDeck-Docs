# <span>Setting up</span> Google Analytics

## Creating an account

If you don't already have an Analytics account -- sign up for one now [on their homepage](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Look for the "Sign Up Now" link (we don't want to link directly as they keep changing these things). If you don't have a Google account (i.e for mail, reader etc) you may have to create one first (look in the top right corner in the sign up page -- they've hidden it well).


## Adding your portfolio to Google Analytics

Once you're up and running with Analytics, login and then click the "cog icon" in the top right cornerâ€¦

You'll be shown a list of your accounts/sites. If you've just signed up it's going to be empty. 

![Getting started](graphics/ga1.png)

1. Click on "New Account" and fill out the details.
2. Name your account. You can call it whatever you like but why not simply call it PortfolioDeck?
2. Select 'http://' and fill in the address for your portfolio. It should be something like 'myportfolio.portfoliodeck.com' (or your custom domain if you have [one of those](custom-domain)). 
3. Select the timezone for where you live.
4. Accept the terms and conditions.
5. Click "Create account"

## Adding the tracking code to PortfolioDeck

If all went well you'll arrive at your new account page. Close to the top of the page you'll find the tracking ID (something like 'UA-28988561-1').

Copy that into the Google Analytics field under the "Customize" tab on your PortfolioDeck admin page.
